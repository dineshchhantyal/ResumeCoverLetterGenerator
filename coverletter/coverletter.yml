    opening: "Dear IXL Learning Hiring Team,"
    body: |
        I am thrilled to apply for the Software Engineer, New Grad position at IXL Learning. As an award-winning Full Stack Engineer with over 4 years of experience in EdTech platforms, I am passionate about leveraging technology to improve education and empower learners globally.

        My journey in EdTech began at Padhao Academy, where I developed a secure authentication system for an educational platform, ensuring GDPR compliance for over 5,000 student accounts. I optimized frontend performance using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, reducing page load times by 35%, and implemented SEO strategies that improved user acquisition and platform discoverability.

        At Clamphook EdTech, I spearheaded the development of a scalable Computer-Based Testing (CBT) platform using Node.js and React, supporting 5,000+ concurrent users and driving a 5x growth in enrollment. I also built real-time analytics dashboards with MongoDB and Chart.js, enhancing student engagement and retention. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I ensured high system uptime and delivered impactful features in a fast-paced startup environment.

        My most recent EdTech contribution is NoteMeet, an AI-powered meeting assistant that automates transcription and summarization tasks using AWS serverless architecture and RAG-powered summaries. This project reduced manual note-taking effort by 80%, showcasing my ability to integrate cutting-edge technologies into user-centric solutions.

        I am particularly drawn to IXL Learning’s mission of creating innovative products that positively impact millions of learners and educators. The opportunity to contribute to your diverse range of educational tools, from IXL.com to Rosetta Stone, aligns perfectly with my passion for improving education through technology. I am eager to bring my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and collaborative mindset to your team.

        I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and experiences align with IXL Learning’s goals and how I can contribute to your impactful products.

    closing: "Sincerely,"
