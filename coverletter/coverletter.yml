    I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineering Intern position at Intuitive. My journey in embedded systems began when I built my first Arduino-based project in high school - a heart rate monitor that could detect irregular rhythms. This early experience with hardware-software integration sparked my passion for medical technology and led me to pursue Computer Science at ULM, where I maintain a 4.0 GPA.

    My research work on optimizing computational methods demonstrates my ability to work with complex systems. While implementing the Meissel-Lehmer algorithm, I utilized low-level C++ optimizations and hardware-specific features to achieve efficient processing - skills directly applicable to developing firmware for Intuitive's surgical systems.

    At ULM, I engineered test automation frameworks using Selenium and Cypress, reducing post-launch errors by 30%. This systematic approach to testing and validation aligns well with Intuitive's need for robust verification of surgical device firmware. I've also gained experience with embedded systems debugging tools and hardware interfaces through various academic projects.

    Working at Clamphook, I developed real-time data processing systems that maintained 99.9% uptime - crucial for medical applications. I implemented comprehensive testing protocols and documentation practices, essential skills for developing surgical robotics software where reliability is paramount.

    What particularly excites me about Intuitive is your mission to advance minimally invasive care through innovative technology. Your da Vinci Surgical System represents the cutting edge of medical robotics, and I am eager to contribute to technology that directly improves patient outcomes.

    I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work on embedded software for surgical devices. My strong foundation in C/C++, experience with system testing, and passion for medical technology make me an ideal candidate for this role.
