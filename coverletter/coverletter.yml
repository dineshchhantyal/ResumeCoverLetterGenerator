    opening: "Dear Cambridge Mobile Telematics Hiring Team,"
    body: |
        I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer II, Back End position at Cambridge Mobile Telematics. With my experience in Python development, AWS cloud services, and building scalable backend systems, I am eager to contribute to CMT's mission of making the world's roads and drivers safer through innovative technology.

        Based on your job requirements, I believe my technical skills and experiences align well with what you're seeking:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Python \& Backend Development:} Throughout my career, I've developed scalable backend applications using Python, implementing complex data processing pipelines and RESTful APIs. At the University of Louisiana - Monroe, I built Python-based services that processed large volumes of data with AWS integration, significantly improving system performance and reliability.

            \item \textbf{AWS \& Containerization:} I have extensive experience with AWS services including EC2, S3, Lambda, SNS, and SQS for building robust cloud applications. I've implemented Docker containerization for consistent development and deployment environments, and created CI/CD pipelines to streamline the development process and ensure code quality.

            \item \textbf{Problem Solving \& Collaboration:} I thrive in solving complex technical problems through creative approaches and data-driven decision making. My experience includes translating business and functional specifications into technical solutions while collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure requirements are met accurately and efficiently.
        \end{itemize}

        I particularly value CMT's hybrid work environment and am fully comfortable with commuting to the Cambridge office three days per week. During my past roles, I've successfully navigated hybrid work arrangements with scheduled in-office collaboration days, maintaining productivity and strong team connections through clear communication channels and effective documentation practices.

        What particularly excites me about joining Cambridge Mobile Telematics is the opportunity to contribute to technology that genuinely improves road safety and saves lives. I'm drawn to CMT's mission of using AI and IoT data to create meaningful insights about driver behavior, and I'm eager to apply my skills in backend development and data processing to help advance this important work.

        I thrive in collaborative environments and have a proven track record of working effectively in cross-functional teams. My experience with Linux development, code reviews, and continuous integration practices has consistently resulted in high-quality, maintainable codeâ€”particularly important in CMT's environment where reliability and performance are critical.

        I am confident that my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and passion for making a positive impact would make me a valuable addition to your team. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with CMT's needs and how I can contribute to your ongoing success in making roads safer through innovative technology.
    closing: "Sincerely,"
