    I am writing to express my interest in the Software Development Co-Op position at [Company] for Summer 2025. As a Computer Science student at the University of Louisiana at Monroe maintaining a 4.0 GPA, I am eager to apply my skills in software development, data analysis, and quality assurance in a dynamic and innovative environment.

    My hands-on experience as a Web Developer at ULM has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I successfully integrated the Microsoft Teams API into our web application, resulting in a 30% increase in user engagement. Additionally, I performed comprehensive end-to-end testing across department webpages, achieving a 98% accuracy rate and enhancing user satisfaction. These experiences demonstrate my ability to deliver efficient, scalable solutions while maintaining high-quality standards.

    At Clamphook, I developed a Computer-Based Testing platform that handled up to 5,000 concurrent users, resulting in a significant increase in student enrollment. I also created an intuitive admin panel that streamlined internal processes and reduced administrative tasks by 30%. My experience in deploying robust frontend and backend components using Docker containerization further highlights my technical proficiency.

    I am particularly drawn to [Company]'s commitment to accelerating the global development of safe and effective medical therapeutics. My proficiency in Java, Python, and SQL, combined with my experience in Agile/Scrum methodologies and cloud technologies, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to [Company]'s strategic initiatives and support the development of high-quality software solutions.

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background, skills, and passion for software development can contribute to [Company]'s continued success.

  closing: "Best regards,"
  enclosure: "Resume"
