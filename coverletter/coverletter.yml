    I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineering Intern position at Brunswick's Navico Group. As a Computer Science student at ULM maintaining a 4.0 GPA, I bring strong C++ programming skills and algorithm development experience that aligns with Navico's embedded systems development needs.

    My research work on the Prime Number Theory project demonstrates my proficiency in C++ and algorithm optimization. I implemented efficient computational methods that achieved a 40% performance improvement through vector mathematics and parallel processing - skills directly applicable to developing positioning algorithms for trolling motors.

    At ULM, I've gained valuable experience in debugging and testing, having automated testing processes for 50+ systems and reduced post-launch errors by 30%. This systematic approach to quality assurance aligns well with Navico's needs for product testing and bug fixing in existing products.

    My experience includes developing real-time data processing systems and working with various communication protocols. At Clamphook, I architected a system supporting 5,000+ concurrent users with 99.9% uptime, demonstrating my ability to build reliable, performant software solutions.

    What particularly excites me about Brunswick is the opportunity to work at the intersection of software and marine technology. Your focus on transforming marine recreation through innovative technology resonates with my passion for creating impactful solutions.

    I am eager to contribute to Navico's trolling motor development team and learn about marine electronics and embedded systems. My strong foundation in C++, experience with debugging tools, and enthusiasm for learning new technologies make me an ideal candidate for this role.
