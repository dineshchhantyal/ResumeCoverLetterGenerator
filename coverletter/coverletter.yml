    I am writing to express my interest in the Investment Analyst Intern position at Manulife for Summer 2025. As a Computer Science student at the University of Louisiana at Monroe maintaining a 4.0 GPA, I am eager to apply my skills in financial modeling and investment analysis in a dynamic and global environment.

    My hands-on experience in full-stack development and my role as a Web Developer at ULM have equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I have successfully created a reusable PHP Drupal module that integrates with Microsoft Teams API, significantly improving student collaboration. Additionally, I engineered an ETL pipeline that migrated over 10,000 records while optimizing data structures, resulting in a 15% improvement in query speed. These experiences demonstrate my ability to deliver efficient, scalable solutions while maintaining high-quality standards.

    At Clamphook, I enhanced a Computer-Based Testing platform to support 5,000 concurrent users and implemented a reward system that boosted student engagement by 30%. My leadership abilities are further evidenced by my role as President of the Google Developer Group at ULM and my achievement as State Champion in the ICPC NA South Division 2024.

    I am particularly drawn to Manulife's commitment to innovation and inclusion. I am confident that my proficiency in financial modeling, extensive financial analysis, and familiarity with accounting principles align perfectly with your technical requirements. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and support strategic initiatives through detailed financial models and investment analysis.

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Manulife's continued success.
  closing: "Best regards"
