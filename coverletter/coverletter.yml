    body: |
        I am thrilled to apply for the Full-stack Web Development Intern position at MyDataProduct. As a Computer Science senior at the University of Louisiana at Monroe with a 4.0 GPA, I bring hands-on experience in Python, React.js, and cloud-based infrastructure, aligning closely with the requirements of this role.

        During my internship at the Simons Foundation, I developed an interactive, \textbf{PyQt-based parallel processing pipeline} with \textbf{3D visualization tools}, processing \textbf{1.2TB of raw cryo-EM and whole-slide images}. This project honed my skills in modular thinking, efficient I/O optimization, and integrating cloud-based storage solutions like Ceph/S3. Additionally, I have built full-stack applications using \textbf{React.js}, \textbf{Tailwind CSS}, and \textbf{Node.js}, and have experience deploying Dockerized applications on cloud platforms.

        My passion for creating scalable, user-centric solutions aligns with MyDataProduct's mission to engineer data-empowered software. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on ML-enabled capabilities and synergistic data integrations, leveraging my background in Python and API development.

        I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to MyDataProduct's innovative projects and collaborate with your talented team. Thank you for considering my application.
