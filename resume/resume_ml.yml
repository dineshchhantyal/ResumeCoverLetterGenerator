summary: |
    ML engineer shipping terabyte-scale vision & RAG systems (\textbf{22x} GPU inference, \textbf{0.91} macro-F1 3D-CNN, event-driven AWS) focused on measurable latency, accuracy, and iteration velocity.

education:
    - name: University of Louisiana at Monroe
      location: Monroe, LA
      degree: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Minor in Mathematics
      GPA: 4.0 / 4.0
      date: Aug 2022 -- May 2026 (Senior)
      courses: Data Structures, Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Database Management, Operating Systems, Computer Networks

experience:
    - title: Software Engineering Intern (ML)
      company: Simons Foundation (SCC, Flatiron Institute)
      location: New York, NY
      date: Jul 2025 -- Aug 2025
      achievements:
          - Architected & shipped a \textbf{PyQt} parallel annotation + streaming pipeline for \textbf{1.2TB} cryo-EM / whole-slide imagery (\textbf{Ceph/S3}, sliding windows) establishing reusable data access + preprocessing patterns.
          - Designed distributed \textbf{GPU} inference + visualization stack (batch scheduler, memory-aware loaders) achieving \textbf{22x} speedup (45m → 2m) across 8xV100 + 2xA100; reduced experiment feedback loop friction for cross-disciplinary scientists.
          - Collaborated with computational biologists refining labeling quality across \textbf{600+} timepoints / \textbf{25K+} cells, raising nucleus state classification to \textbf{0.91} macro F1 via custom spatio-temporal \textbf{3D-CNN} (PyTorch).
          - Open-sourced \textbf{Chart-Gizmos} (Chart.js + H5Gizmos) with modular API + docs—enabled reproducible, browser-based exploratory data analysis.

    - title: Software Developer
      company: University of Louisiana - Monroe
      location: Monroe, LA
      date: Jan 2023 -- Present
      achievements:
          - Led integration of \textbf{Microsoft Teams API} with \textbf{Drupal CMS} (\textbf{OAuth 2.0}) enabling real-time messaging & calendar sync; automated workflows cut manual coordination \textbf{85%} (4h → 30m weekly).
          - Engineered \textbf{Python/MySQL ETL} + schema optimization migrating \textbf{10K+} legacy records into Drupal 10; improved query latency \textbf{15%} and storage cost \textbf{10%} via index & column strategy.
          - Instituted \textbf{Selenium} + \textbf{Cypress} test harness across 50+ pages in CI/CD raising pre-deployment defect detection \textbf{75%}; established review & QA checklist adopted by team.
          - Partnered with stakeholders (IT, content, compliance) to prioritize backlog, clarify acceptance criteria, and deliver incremental releases with traceable change logs.

    - title: Software Developer
      company: Clamphook
      location: Lalitpur, NP
      date: Oct 2022 -- May 2023
      achievements:
          - Spearheaded architecture for \textbf{Node.js} + \textbf{React} CBT platform with \textbf{Redis} caching, \textbf{NGINX} load balancing, and modular service boundaries—scaled to \textbf{5,000+} concurrent users supporting 5x enrollment growth.
          - Implemented \textbf{Docker/Kubernetes} microservices with \textbf{Helm} + GitLab CI/CD pipelines (lint, test, rollout gates) reaching \textbf{99.9%} production uptime; created deployment playbooks & rollback runbooks.
          - Built real-time analytics dashboard (\textbf{TypeScript}, \textbf{MongoDB}, \textbf{Chart.js}) surfacing performance & engagement metrics—drove \textbf{8%} user engagement lift and informed product iteration cadence.
